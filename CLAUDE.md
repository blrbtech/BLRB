## Key Implementation Details

### Lane System Architecture
- **Preloaded Content**: All 50 articles (10 per lane) loaded on page load
- **Horizontal Container**: CSS transforms for smooth sliding
- **Lane Positions**: AI=0, TECH=1, PRODUCTS=2, DEV=3, CRYPTO=4
- **Distance-Based Animation**: Longer lane jumps = longer transition time

### Today's Hits Carousel
- **5 Featured Stories**: GPT-5, Vision Pro 2, Microsoft AI Deal, Copilot Workspace, Ethereum Staking
- **Full-Width Design**: Extends edge-to-edge with single story visibility
- **Optimized Gradients**: Soft black-to-transparent fade (80% ‚Üí 20% ‚Üí transparent)
- **Smart Navigation Arrows**: Only visible when scrolling is possible (hide at first/last)
- **Clean Interactions**: Headlines/text link to articles, BLRB buttons open detailed views
- **No Source Labels**: Streamlined design without redundant topic/source text
- **Smooth Scrolling**: CSS snap points with proper touch support
- **Hidden Scrollbars**: Clean visual appearance

### Mobile Interaction
- **Touch Events**: Proper horizontal swipe detection
- **Vertical Scroll Preservation**: Doesn't interfere with page scrolling
- **Swipe Thresholds**: 50px minimum distance, 500ms maximum time
- **Touch Action**: `pan-y` to allow vertical scrolling

### Content Structure
- **Story Objects**: Each has lane, source, title, blurb, and unique ID
- **Mock Publishers**: TechCrunch, The Verge, Bloomberg, GitHub, CoinDesk, etc.
- **Realistic Content**: All articles have believable tech news headlines

### Analytics Implementation
- **Google Analytics 4**: Property ID G-8NLHDPTR6M integrated in head section
- **Custom Events Tracked**:
  - `newsletter_popup_opened` - User engagement with signup form
  - `blrb_clicked` - Story engagement with unique story IDs
  - `lane_changed` - Content category browsing patterns
- **Safety Checks**: All tracking includes `typeof gtag !== 'undefined'` error handling
- **Event Categories**: engagement, navigation for organized reporting

## Development Workflow

3. **Edit HTML File**: Make changes to `index.html` for latest version
4. **Test Features**: Verify lane switching, hits scrolling, mobile swipe, article interactions

## Future Development Notes

### If Building Next.js Version:
- Reference `blrb-web/src/app/page.tsx` for component structure
- Port the lane system logic to React state management
- Convert CSS animations to Framer Motion or similar
- Implement proper data fetching for story content

### If Enhancing HTML Demo:
- All core functionality is complete and working
- Focus on content updates, visual polish, or performance
- The architecture supports easy content additions

### Performance Considerations:
- Current demo loads 50 articles on page load (acceptable for demo)
- For production, consider lazy loading lane content
- Image assets are currently placeholder gradients (by design)

## Brand Guidelines
- **Tone**: Technical, direct, builder-focused
- **Colors**: Electric blue (#00b4ff) + Cyan (#20d3ce) gradients only
- **Typography**: Bold, uppercase tracking for headers
- **Design Philosophy**: Clean, architectural feel with sharp corners (no rounded edges)
- **Interactions**: Smooth, premium feel with proper easing
- **Mobile-First**: Touch interactions are primary UX
- **Subscribe Form**: Professional with tight spacing, larger blue headings
- **Navigation**: Minimal dropdown over complex sliding panels
